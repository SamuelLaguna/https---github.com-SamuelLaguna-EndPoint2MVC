We are to make 3 seprate api calls in a controller. The first one is to make a endpoint that states the "The sum of 2 and 2 is 4.". The next endpoint is to return " What is your name (name), what time did you wake up (time);. The third one is return " num1 is greater than num2" "num2 is less than num1" "num1 is equal to num2".
